DRUPAL SIEGE

Use this script just like you would siege; all arguments will get passed to siege. You must be using version 2.70b or above: 

ftp://ftp.joedog.org/pub/siege/beta/

Previous versions won't return cookies set by Drupal (See changelog: ftp://ftp.joedog.org/pub/siege/beta/ChangeLog).

KNOWN ISSUES

Currently, you can't specify a siegerc file with the -R flag. However, your regular siegerc will be used (siege -C to see where it is...)

USAGE
